# IA-318-Reinforcement-learning
Repository for my work over the 3rd year course IA-301 (now APM_5AI18_TP) - Reinforcement Learning.

## Abstract
Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning inspired by the way living beings learn to improve themselves by interacting with their environment. Typically, young animals are curious, try a lot of different actions before concentrating on the best ones, following a trial-and-error strategy. It is tempting (but far from easy) to let machines learn this way to improve their intelligence and accomplish some specific tasks. 

The applications are numerous: robotics, medicine, content recommendation, games, to quote a few.

We'll cover some key techniques and concepts of reinforcement learning:

* Markov Decision Process
* Dynamic programming
* Online evaluation
* Online control
* Policy gradient
* Bandits algorithms
* Parametric bandits
